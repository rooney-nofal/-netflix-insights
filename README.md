### What is Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a branch of AI where computers learn from data to make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

### What is Data Pre-processing
Data pre-processing involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis or machine learning. It includes tasks like handling missing values, converting data types, and normalizing values.

### What is Descriptive Data Analysis
Descriptive data analysis summarizes and interprets data using statistical methods and visualizations to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships.

### AI in a Real-World Domain: Finance
In the finance sector, AI is used to detect fraudulent transactions, assess credit risk, automate trading, provide personalized financial advice, and analyze large volumes of market data to support investment decisions.
